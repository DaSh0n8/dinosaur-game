WBA:

For this iteration, we will be splitting the work based on our past experiences with iteration 1, and how each classes are related to each other (eg: lake related to thirsty dinosaur)

Brandon will be responsible for implementing the following features:
1.	Lake, water and rain
2.	Thirsty Dinosaur
3.	Second map

Zi Jie will be responsible for implementing the following features:
1.	Pterodactyls
2.	A more sophisticated game driver
3.	Remaining iteration 1 features (Breeding, Eating)

Although the features are split up here, we will actively help each other when encountering a problem.

Time arrangement:
Set up multiple due dates to check progress of work, and ultimately finishing everything by 25th May

Signatures:
Zi Jie (I accept this WBA)
