WBA:

As both of us think that we might have very different design ideas, we have decided to discuss the design idea for all
features. After deciding the design ideas, we are going to split the features evenly and start constructing the
Class and Interaction diagrams. By discussing together, we can achieve a better design idea and will also be familiar 
with the way how each feature is going to work.

For design rationale, we will write based on the features which we have been constructing the diagrams for. We will
explain how each feature will work and why we choose to implement the designs.


Time arrangement:

We will review our work on 23/4 or the day before to make sure our works are fine.
